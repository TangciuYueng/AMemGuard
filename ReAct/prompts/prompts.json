So the answer is no.\nAnswer: No\nQuestion: Will the Albany in Georgia reach a hundred thousand occupants before the one in New York?\nThought: As of the most recent population estimates, Albany, New York, had a population of approximately 97,000 residents, while Albany, Georgia, had a population of around 73,000 residents. Albany, New York, is the capital of the state and is a major center for business, education, and government. It has a long history and economic significance, which attracts people to live and work in the area.On the other hand, Albany, Georgia, while an important regional center, is a smaller city in comparison. It does not have the same level of economic or cultural influence as Albany, New York.

Layers of dirt and rock covered the plants over millions of years. The resulting pressure and heat turned the plants into the substance we call coal.\nThought: Based on the information, I can check each option. A: coal is made by plants, not animals, so A is false. B: I have no information about if coal is formed from magma yet. I could search 'is coal formed from magma' to make sure. C: I have no information about if coal quickly becomes petrified when water is removed. I could search 'does coal quicklybecome petrified when water is removed' to make sure. D: Coal takes millions of years to form, so D is possibly true.
